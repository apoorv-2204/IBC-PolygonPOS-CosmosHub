Polygon POS and Cosmos Gaia both offer deterministic finality.
The repository's purpose is to use the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) to connect Polygon's Proof of Stake (PoS) with Cosmos Gaia.
IBC callbacks are already available on the (cosmos)Gaia chain.The same is to be done  for the Polygon PoS chain. Furthermore, the Hermes Relayer will be used to help in the transit of messages and tokens across blockchains.
